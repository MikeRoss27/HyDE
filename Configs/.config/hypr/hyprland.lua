-- Hyprland loads this file when it is started without a config, and it prefers
-- it over hyprland.conf. HyDE loads it too, last, as the override layer below.
-- The block keeps the two apart: hyde.lua sets `hyde` on its first line, so it
-- runs only when this file is the entry point and HyDE has not been loaded.
-- Removing it leaves a session with a cursor and nothing else.

	local share = os.getenv("XDG_DATA_HOME") or (os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/share")

-- Your Hyprland configuration. HyDE never overwrites this file.
--
-- It loads after HyDE's own binds, so settings here take precedence. Replacing
-- a bind needs more than that: see below. HyDE's defaults live in
-- ~/.local/share/hypr/lua/ and are overwritten on every update, so edits there
-- do not survive.
--
-- Adding a keybind:
--
--     hl.bind("SUPER + SPACE", hl.dsp.exec_cmd(hyde.sh.gamelauncher()), {
--         description = "[Utilities] game launcher",
--     })
--
-- Replacing one of HyDE's: bind the same combination again and yours takes
-- over, but copy its flags across as well. A bind counts as the same one only
-- when its flags match, and `description` is not a flag — miss one and both
-- binds stay live on that combination. Copy the whole options table from
-- ~/.local/share/hypr/lua/key_binds.lua and change only what you need:
--
--     hl.bind("F9", hl.dsp.exec_cmd(hyde.sh.volumecontrol("-o", "m")), {
--         locked = true,
--         description = "[Hardware Controls|Audio] un/mute output",
--     })
--
-- Press SUPER + / to see what is actually loaded, your own binds included.
-- The full reference is KEYBINDINGS.md in the HyDE repository.
--
-- Other Lua files next to this one can be pulled in with require("name").

-- HDMI-A-1 (external, main) sits physically to the left on the desk, eDP-1
-- (laptop panel) to the right. Hyprland's auto-arrangement put eDP-1 at 0x0
-- instead, so moving a window "left" from the external monitor went to the
-- laptop panel even though it sits to the right in real life. Swapped here
-- to match physical layout.
